on Windows, does not have logging enabled, which could allow remote attackers to conduct activities without detection.\n[CVE-2002-1921] The default configuration of MySQL 3.20.32 through 3.23.52, when running on Windows, does set the bind address to the loopback interface, which allows remote attackers to connect to the database.\n[CVE-2002-1809] The default configuration of the Windows binary release of MySQL 3.23.2 through 3.23.52 has a NULL root password, which could allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized root access to the MySQL database.\n[CVE-2002-1479] Cacti before 0.6.8 stores a MySQL username and password in plaintext in config.php, which has world-readable permissions, which allows local users modify databases as the Cacti user and possibly gain privileges.\n[CVE-2002-1376] libmysqlclient client library in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.54, and 4.x to 4.0.6, does not properly verify length fields for certain responses in the (1) read_rows or (2) read_one_row routines, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n[CVE-2002-1375] The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x before 3.23.54, and 4.x to 4.0.6, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long response.\n[CVE-2002-1374] The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x before 3.23.54, and 4.x before 4.0.6, allows remote attackers

before 3.23.31 allows attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly gain privileges.\n[CVE-2001-1255] WinMySQLadmin 1.1 stores the MySQL password in plain text in the my.ini file, which allows

passed to the MySQL database.\n[CVE-2001-1044] Basilix Webmail 0.9.7beta, and possibly other versions, stores *.class and *.inc files under the document root and does not restrict access, which could allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information such as MySQL passwords and usernames from the mysql.class file.\n[CVE-2001-0990] Inter7 vpopmail 4.10.35 and earlier, when using the MySQL module, compiles authentication information in cleartext into the libvpopmail.a library, which allows local users to obtain the MySQL username and password by inspecting the vpopmail programs that use the library.\n[CVE-2001-0645] Symantec/AXENT NetProwler 3.5.x contains several default passwords, which could allow remote attackers to (1) access to the management tier via the \"admin\" password, or
